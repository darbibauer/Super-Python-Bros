# Super-Python-Bros

# Project Description
In this project, we recreated the original NES Super Mario Bros. We implemented a menu interface and four levels from World 1.

# Gameplay Instructions
In our game, the play option on the menu is selected by pressing enter. Mario is moved left and right using A and S respectively. He jumps using L, and doubles his speed by pressing K. One difference from the original game to note is that the Goombas in Level 2 and Level 3 cannot be squished, they only serve as obstacles for Mario. To play the full game, run menuGUI.py. You can also run the individual levels by running Level1.py, Level2Beginning.py, Level3.py, or Level4.py.

# Python Libraries
We used pygame to implement nearly all gameplay features. We used sys to connect all the levels in the menuGUI files. We also used time to get the correct timing for the sound effects and cut screens.

# Resources
We found all images used in the game either through Google searches, or cropping the maps we found (provided in Maps folder).  We got our sound effects from https://themushroomkingdom.net/media/smb/wav. Additionally, we used a YouTube tutorial to implement the side-scrolling feature which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX8YU2hLBUg&t=349s.
